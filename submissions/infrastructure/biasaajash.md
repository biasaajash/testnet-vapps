Project: zkMonitor – Transparent On-chain Analytics
Category: infrastructure

Description
zkMonitor is a transparency and analytics platform for decentralized apps.  
It provides verifiable metrics such as total value locked (TVL), number of active users, and transaction counts, all backed by zkProofs and verified via Soundness Layer (SL).  
Problem solved: protocol teams often publish metrics without proof, making it hard for users to trust the data. zkMonitor ensures analytics are accurate and provably correct.

SL Integration
- SL will verify zkProofs of aggregated blockchain data (TVL, user counts).  
- Proofs ensure that analytics are consistent with on-chain data, without exposing individual user information.  
- Features used: proof verification, zk-friendly APIs, data transparency audit trail.

Technical
Architecture
Flow: Smart contracts emit events → Data aggregator collects → zk circuit generates proof → SL verifies → Dashboard displays results.  

Stack
- Frontend: React + Next.js (analytics dashboard)  
- Backend: Node.js (data aggregator + zk proof generator)  
- Blockchain: Soundness Layer (testnet), Ethereum for data source  
- Storage: IPFS for storing aggregated proof metadata  

Features
- Core Feature 1: Verifiable TVL (total value locked) for DeFi protocols.  
- Core Feature 2: Proof-backed active user metrics.  
- Core Feature 3: Public dashboard for transparency (analytics explorer).  

Timeline
- PoC (2-4 weeks)  
  - Setup data aggregator  
  - Simple zk circuit for transaction counting  
  - SL proof verification integration  
  - Basic analytics dashboard  

- MVP (4-8 weeks)  
  - Multi-metric support (TVL, users, volume)  
  - Proof explorer for public verification  
  - Optimized dashboard + user testing  

Innovation
- Unique: first zkProof-powered analytics platform for DeFi/gaming.  
- Removes the need to “trust” project teams’ claims, replacing with verifiable data.  
- Can be extended as an API service for multiple protocols.  

Contact
- Preferred: Discord DM (biasanya)  
- Updates: GitHub repo (public) + Soundness Layer Discord.
